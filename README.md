# Simple-TV-to-Smart-TV-project
The project is based on IOT, how to convert a simple TV(having a HDMI port) to a Smart TV i.e used to stream online content.
I have used KODI an open source media center, which provides you various functionalities using the addons.
I have deployed KODI on the Raspberry PI 3, along with the script to directly launch KODI on the start of the Raspian OS.
